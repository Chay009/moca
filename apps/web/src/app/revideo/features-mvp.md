dithering,shaders which are shiny
1. is orcshot which is parmantirc video en
2.one is video editor +ai
3. like ai gen ike hera.video and reelroll- which we genera genrator functions with4.  some assts
4. is screenity.pro 
5. ou  video editor included rotato.app and slanit as well but better seprate this acts as engine

reeroll,hera,jitter have stempates copy them
and for the effect i got one idea one is transition between two scene via text zoom it like O going inside the o by camera and clip the other scene to shift

for our slanit+screenity-- Recording (rrweb/Screenity) what we do special is we can detect clicks/interactions in real-time and ccapture dom instead of video so we add effects and edir dom
Auto-zoom during capture - built into the recording tool
Detects clicks/interactions in real-time
Zooms automatically as you record
https://screen.studio/
for our rrweb slannit screenity.pro aternative  cusom cursor as wel
like cluseo have it where llm provides codinrs to blur and we need to do it

https://x.com/amnxnet/status/1997246132876095806 one more inspiration
orshot.com where we want the video api which is future once we set all the things in cleint we can just move to ssr
we need to folllow this for features
i think this uses og for images and video is same like ssr rendering for motion revideo and remotion-lambda if remotion 
parametized is actually the revideo thing(🎬 Runtime customization - Change variables when rendering video server-side
🔄 Template system - One project, many outputs with different variables
📹 Programmatic rendering - API-driven video generation)

the thing is one is animtion generator like reelroll hera.video etc which gives ai and gets the code which we need to add as templeate of scenes which can be imported as librry like animtion lbrary 

then other thing is parametized

the eldito whill have clusoe slannit,rotato lotti etc and ater we integrate ai to get and import

so all thse feature we make paretized a json then later we will render servwr side
-------



i think this is much simpler i guess like once done in web we can use revideo servi to render as api for video
for imag- may be we need browswe+cloudflare
but it is just json swnd and render

---

----
like we have 
1. text effects
2.then bckgrounds
3. then we have elements (in which shapes,clipmask and most importants mockups comes which included both video and image)
4. then we have transitions
----

feature- to add brand logos,typograpy and color as brandkit and can mke sahders effects animtisnd to it

then other big one mockups

feature-- for videos we need to have something like selecting a coridnate or area and can have effect like zoom in blur etc and camera is the most useful thing here


feature-- video effects like cleuso let use select shapes  like freedraw,rect etc we need to somehow get that area of thet video and can effects like zoom and blur etc of that selectd area for a duration of users choice


animated icons like atleast arrows with generators

skewing videos shou be there with controls of angle for video to let them show for product lauches etc 

screen.studio+screenity/pro it is more like (slannit+rotato)
fuck we need slantit.app --- we need to replicate few features (this takes already existing video and make it slant(Slant it - but it's post-production, not live) but we are trying to make a live version

 so we create slantit++

we can export our video into lottie format to add in ui as well like custom ui is left bottom where perplixity or v0 adds lotie or gif not sure

textures or patterns
https://unsplash.com/collections/3404830/textures-abstract-backgrounds

and shots.so is the perfect for gradients,images etc

noise gradients and dithers --- are by shaders
also motion canvas narrotor to automate or for face less creators
one more is transiptions based on clippath
unicorn.studio or paper.design --- for shaders and effects
pool with spawners is to make the rendering optmial so range.. create it as var and tae slice refer
transitions between scenes -- should be implemented like this https://motioncanvas.io/api/core/transitions/#fadeTransition

thing this way wanted to add a thing which will zoom and some prebuilt stuff from the editor itself
like user can go to a timestamp of range and can add something like add zoom and can point the part in video so this will give the cursorful effect more like clueso
video zoom in is needed ?i'e camera component is the actual solution to do it  here --

Yes—**still the most viable of the three**, but only if you **scope the creative work brutally**.

What makes it feel “too big” is the open-ended design problem: *“infinite text effects, backgrounds, transitions…”*  
Kill that scope and it collapses into a **very doable 2-week MVP**.

----------------------------------------------------
Brutal scope-lock for a *pay-people-actually-buy* MVP

1. **Templates, not a free-form editor**  
   - Ship 3 templates (e.g. “Product Hunt dark”, “SaaS light”, “Mobile app gradient”).  
   - Each template is < 20 s, 4–5 text fields, 1 logo drop-zone, 1 accent color picker.  
   - User touches **nothing** except the text boxes, color, logo; everything else is baked into the Motion-Canvas code.

2. **Asset pack you build once**  
   - 15 royalty-free loopable 4-sec backgrounds (abstract gradients, subtle patterns, blurred video loops).  
   - 5 pre-baked text animations (slide-up, pop-in, glitch, typewriter, kinetic scale).  
   - 3 transition snippets (dip-to-black, slide, quick zoom).  
   → That is **one evening in After-Effects / Blender** to render the loops, then you’re done.

3. **Render pipeline is already solved**  
   - Motion-Canvas spits out an mp4/webm at 1080×1920 (vertical) or 1920×1080 (horizontal) @ 30 fps.  
   - No server rent; everything runs in the browser—cost = $0.

4. **Pricing that matches the pain**  
   - Watermarked preview for free.  
   - Pay $19 to download the clean 1080 p file.  
   - Or $49 lifetime that also unlocks the horizontal version + future templates.

----------------------------------------------------
Result:  
Creative surface area is tiny (you design 3 templates once), tech surface is tiny (Motion-Canvas already renders), and you’re solving the **exact pain** indie founders complain about on Twitter/PH every week.
https://www.ls.graphics/mockups/free-iphone-mockup?page=3
So yes—**viable**, but **only if you refuse to build a general-purpose video editor**. Build the *“3-slide PowerPoint that exports a 15-second launch video”* and you can have it live and taking payments before May ends.
