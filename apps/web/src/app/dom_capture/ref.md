My Honest Recommendation: 3 Products (or 2 with a sub-brand)
Here's what I think based on everything you've shared:

1. SlantIt → Video Effects Tool
Input: Raw video files
Output: Stylized video with tilt, perspective, transforms
Target: Content creators, video editors
Tech: Three.js
Simple, focused scope
2. Device Mockups → Could be part of SlantIt OR separate
You're right that mobile showcases are mostly image-based:

App Store screenshots = images
Landing page hero = images
Product Hunt = images
My take: Make it a feature within SlantIt, not a separate product. It's just "place your video/image in a device frame" - not complex enough to stand alone.

3. DOM Recording Tool → SEPARATE PRODUCT ✅
This is the right call. Here's why:

Factor	Why Separate?
Different user	SaaS founders, product marketers, devrel
Different workflow	Record → Edit DOM → Animate → Export
Different marketing	"Create product demos without After Effects"
Different competitors	Arcade, Storylane, Navattic, etc.
Premium positioning	Can charge more for SaaS tooling
The After Effects tutorial you shared shows what people want but currently need expensive software + skills to achieve. A DOM-aware tool that does this automatically is a different value prop.

The DOM tool has enough unique value to justify its own brand, pricing, and marketing.

Arcade	Screen recording + annotations	Full 3D effects, not just annotations
Storylane	Interactive demos	Cinematic video output
Loom	Screen recording	DOM-aware editing
After Effects	Manual animation	Automatic from DOM recording
